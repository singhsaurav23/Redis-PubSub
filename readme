Subscription: When you call subscribe(channel, callback), the Redis client listens for any messages published to the specified channel. The callback function is associated with that channel, and Redis will keep listening for messages on that channel.

The callback is not called immediately when subscribe() is executed but will be invoked each time a message is published to the subscribed channel.
Publishing: When a message is published to the channel using publish(channel, message), the subscribed client(s) will receive that message.

Callback Execution: When the message is published, Redis will notify the subscriber(s) by calling the callback function that was registered when subscribe() was initially called. The message argument in the callback function is the message that was published.

Key Points:
The subscribe method initiates listening on a Redis channel.
The callback function will not be executed until something is published to that channel.
Each time a new message is published to the channel, the callback is called with the message contents.
